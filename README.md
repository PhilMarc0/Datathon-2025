# Datathon-2025
##  Overview
This repository contains the model that we have used as part of SMU BIA's Datathon 2025 case competition. During this case competition, we constructed a predictive model that will be useful in predicting future threats or terrorism by feeding in textual data into the models for training and subsequently run some testing.
